Bonzai (Beta)
=============

**Bonzai** is a kick-starting Wordpress development stack for mastering your automated deployments and others
repetitive tasks.

The main goal of this stack is to provide a pre-configured bunch of tools that will help you build and deploy your WordPress sites in no time!

> **IMPORTANT:** Please note that this stack is on a beta version. We are Freelance developers and we use this stack for our own projects. We just wanted to
share this with you, however, all the uses cases have not been tested yet. It should work on all platforms, however, you have to be used to work with the
included tools, and you need to be able to understand the code written in the core repository. We won't provide any support using it. However, feel free to
open some issues if you find something not working or post some pull request and we'll attempt to make all our possible to improve the stack!

Not reinventing the wheel
-------------------------

**Bonzai** was never meant to be yet another WordPress Stack including all you could need to build a site. We instead chose to build it on the best
libraries available in the open-source world and make them work together in a unified way.

**Bonzai** has been built using those technologies available on Windows:

- VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Puphpet for running your Virtual Machine
- Git, Putty and Pageant for managing your repositories
- NodeJS, GruntJS for managing all your development tasks
- Composer for managing your plugins
- ShipitJS for deploying your files to your servers
- WP Cli, WPMDB Pro and WPMDB cli for managing your databases migrations
- And really more ...
